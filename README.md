I am working on a user-centered design project titled "Smart Home Solutions Store" â€” an online shop for selecting and buying smart home devices and integrated solutions. The project aims to address user needs related to device compatibility, seamless system integration, and reliable customer support. Alongside a team of four classmates, I conducted user research through interviews and surveys, and analyzed existing smart home retailers to understand market gaps. Based on the insights gathered, we created user personas, defined the main problem, brainstormed innovative ideas, and developed initial low-fidelity prototypes focused on user experience and functionality. This document summarizes our research process, key findings, and design directions.
